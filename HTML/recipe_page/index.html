      <li>granulated sugar</li>
      <li>large eggs</li>
      <li>vanilla extract</li>
      <li>almond extract</li>
      <li>sour cream</li>
      <li>whole milk</li>
      <li>cake flour</li>
      <li>baking powder</li>
      <li>baking soda</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°F (either convection or regular). Spray with
        non-stick cooking spray and line a round 9-inch cake pan with a
        parchment paper circle. I trace an outline of my cake pan on the
        parchment paper and then cut out a circle inside my sharpie marks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In another
        bowl whisk together the sour cream and milk. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or with
        a hand mixer) cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the
        extracts with the last egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternately add milk and dry ingredients, beginning and ending with dry.
        I often finish folding by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into prepared pans. You can use a kitchen scale to put
        exactly the same amount in both pans. For 2 cakes, it will be 670g each.
        Spread out with an offset spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake immediately in preheated oven until a cake tester or toothpick
        comes out with a few clinging crumbs, approximately 20-25 minutes. Be
        careful not to over bake or it will dry out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the cake to cool 10 minutes in the pan then turn out onto a wire
        rack. Remove the parchment from the bottom of the cake and allow to cool
        completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the buttercream</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the
        butter until smooth and lightened slightly on medium-high speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the powdered sugar ½ cup at a
        time, allowing it to mix in completely before adding the next batch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once all the sugar has been incorporated add the vanilla and vanilla
        bean seeds (optional) and mix on medium speed until light and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Switch to the whisk attachment and add cream while mixing on medium-low
        speed. Then increase the speed to high and whisk until light and fluffy
        and white.
      </li>
    </ol>
